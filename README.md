# react-redux-webpack-template

This is a simple template for building React apps using 
redux (https://github.com/rackt/redux).
 
I also added a base actions and a simple component. 

## How to use this

  * Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ernestofreyreg/react-redux-webpack-template my-new-project`
  * Install the dependencies: `cd my-new-project && npm install`
  * Start webpack: `npm start`
  * Add your code to `index.js` and open `index.html`
  

This repo is inspired by Pete Hunt's https://github.com/petehunt/react-webpack-template I just added a couple features more.

  * SCSS loader
  * Immutables
  * Base actions
  * Simple demo component
  * Bootstrap & Font-Awesome CSS from CDN
